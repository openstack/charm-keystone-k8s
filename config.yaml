      This is the maximum number of active keys. It has a minimum of 3, which includes the
      spare and staging keys. When set to 3, the rotation time for the keys is the same as
      the token expiration time. When set to a higher value, the rotation time is less than
      the `token-expiration` time as calculated by:

      rotation-time = token-expiration / (fernet-max-active-keys -2)

      Please see the charm documentation for further details about how to use the Fernet token
      parameters to achieve a key strategy appropriate for the system in question.
